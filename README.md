# Predictive-Analytics-for-Employee-Retention

This project aims to provide data-driven suggestions for the Human Resources (HR) department of a large consulting firm by analyzing employee data and building predictive models. The goal is to predict whether an employee will leave the company, helping HR to make informed decisions and retain valuable employees.

## Project Description
This capstone project involves analyzing a dataset and building predictive models to provide insights to the HR department. The project includes the following key components:
- **Predictive Modeling:** Implemented both regression and machine learning models to predict employee attrition.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated the models and interpreted the results.
- **Data Visualization:** Created visualizations to represent the analysis and findings.
- **Ethical Considerations:** Addressed ethical issues related to data analysis and model predictions.

## Installation
To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```
git clone https://github.com/ayush8587/employee-retention-analysis.git
cd employee-retention-analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the Jupyter notebook to see the full analysis and results.
```jupyter notebook notebooks/Employee_Retention_Analysis.ipynb```
Alternatively, you can run the Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
```
python src/data_preprocessing.py
python src/model_training.py
python src/model_evaluation.py
```

## Results
The predictive models provide insights into employee attrition, including factors that contribute to employees leaving the company. The visualizations created in the notebook help in understanding the key factors and the performance of the models.

## Ethical Considerations
The project considers ethical implications related to data privacy, bias in model predictions, and the responsible use of data-driven insights. Efforts were made to ensure that the analysis and models do not unfairly target specific groups of employees.
